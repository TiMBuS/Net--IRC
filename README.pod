Elegant. Simple. Probably doesn't compile.

=head1 Synopsis

 use Net::IRC::Bot;

 class AnnoyUsers does ExtraAnnoying {
     #Will be called when the bot gets a join event
     multi method joined ($who, $channel, $e) {
          $e.reply("Hi there, $who!"); 
     }
 }

 role ExtraAnnoying {
     #Called on a regular privmsg event
     multi method said ($msg, $who, $channel, $e) {
         $e.reply($msg); #Parrot back what was said;
     }

Its an IRC Bot framework! Theres not much else to it.
It's currently in active development (read:broken + everything is changing constantly),
so unless you just want ot look or have an experimental tinker, you might want to wait 
for just a little bit.
